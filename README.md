# How to Design an API

Have you ever asked yourself, how you should design an API - REST or Event â€” you won't hate to use?
The project tries to bring you the process how to define an API you would love to use step by step.
We assume that the API is defined in an API-First approach. That means, we will define the API and only afterward we
will implement client and server or for events consumer and producer.

The entire process is explained, using an example, which shouldn't be too easy, but which shouldn't be too complex
as well.
The example is a task management system. The DDD process with 
[Domain Story Telling](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNX-5o1M=/?moveToWidget=3458764567631790957&cot=14) 
and [Event Storming](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNX-5o1M=/?moveToWidget=3458764567635760342&cot=14) is already done.
